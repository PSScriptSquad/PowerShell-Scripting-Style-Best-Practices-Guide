# About this Guide

After years of scripting and reviewing others' scripts, I have developed a unique style and set of standards. Recently, I realized that many of my conventions align with formally named and documented practices. This guide, inspired by the [PowerShell Practice and Style guide](https://poshcode.gitbook.io/powershell-practice-and-style), summarizes key points from that resource, adds my insights, and provides a customized standard for my peers and AI to reference when scripting. Initially, I considered contributing to their repository, but given the extent of my changes and the fact that the original was last updated over a year ago, I decided to create my own version. The authors of the original guide encourage widespread redistribution of their content, so approximately 90% of this guide is derived from their work.
