# About this Guide

After years of scripting and reviewing others' scripts, I have developed a style and set of standards. Recently, I discovered that many of my conventions are formally named and documented. This guide, inspired by the [PowerShell Practice and Style guide](https://poshcode.gitbook.io/powershell-practice-and-style), summarizes points from that resource, adds additional insights, and provides a customized standard for my peers and AI to reference when scripting. The authors of the original guide encourage widespread redistribution of their content, so approximately 90% of this guide is derived from their work.
