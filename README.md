# Introduction

PowerShell Best Practices are constantly evolving, adapting to changes in the language and tools. These practices serve as a solid foundation for writing, thinking, and designing in PowerShell, making it less likely to encounter issues. While there are exceptions to these best practices and style rules, they provide a baseline for code structure, command design, programming, formatting, and style. Following these guidelines helps avoid common problems and ensures your code is reusable and readableâ€”reusable code doesn't need rewriting, and readable code is easier to maintain.

Remember, the Scripting Style and Best Practices Guide are recommendations, not rigid rules. If you're struggling to follow a style or best practice and it's hindering your progress, you've missed the point. This document is meant to be pragmatic, not dogmatic.
